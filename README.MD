Agent Pay integrates seamlessly into Whapple Pay, providing agents the ability to deposit cash into users' accounts. With the Agent Pay system, agents can:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Open Issues and Areas for Improvement

We currently have some open issues that need attention, and we‚Äôd love to see contributions in the following areas:

### 1. UI Enhancements
- The user interface can be improved to provide a more **modern and intuitive experience**. Contributions to enhance the UI for both agents and users will be highly appreciated.

### 2. Security Enhancements
- While the current system is secure, **additional security checks** should be implemented, especially for handling sensitive user data and payment transactions. Contributions towards **encrypting sensitive data**, **validating agent authentication**, and **securing API calls** are encouraged.
  
  We also encourage implementing **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for agent logins, as well as other security practices that can help mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities.
